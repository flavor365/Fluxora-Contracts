# Gas / Budget Review: Hot Paths and Batching

This document characterises the Soroban CPU-instruction and memory-byte cost
profile for the three hot paths in the Fluxora streaming contract, explains the
batching design decisions, and records the observable guarantees that integrators
and auditors can rely on.

---

## Hot paths

### 1. `withdraw` (single stream)

**Call pattern:** recipient calls once per stream per claim cycle.

**Work done per call:**
- 1× persistent storage read (`load_stream`)
- 1× `calculate_accrued` (pure arithmetic, no storage)
- 1× persistent storage write + TTL bump (`save_stream`) — only when `withdrawable > 0`
- 1× token `transfer` call (contract → recipient) — only when `withdrawable > 0`
- 1–2× event publishes (`withdrew`, optionally `completed`)

**Zero-withdrawable short-circuit:** when `accrued == withdrawn_amount` (before
cliff, or already fully withdrawn) the function returns `0` immediately — no
storage write, no token transfer, no event. This is the cheapest possible
outcome and is safe to call speculatively.

**Guardrail (unit + integration tests):** ≤ 1 000 000 CPU instructions,
≤ 500 000 memory bytes per single call.

### 2. `batch_withdraw` (N streams, one auth)

**Call pattern:** recipient calls once to drain multiple streams in one
transaction.

**Gas-saving vs N individual `withdraw` calls:**
- Authorization is paid **once** for the entire batch instead of once per stream.
- The Soroban auth overhead (signature verification, sub-invocation tree) is the
  dominant fixed cost per transaction; batching amortises it across all streams.

**Work done per stream entry:**
- 1× persistent storage read (`load_stream`)
- 1× `calculate_accrued` (pure arithmetic)
- 1× persistent storage write + TTL bump — only when `withdrawable > 0`
- 1× token `transfer` — only when `withdrawable > 0`
- 1–2× event publishes — only when `withdrawable > 0`

**Status semantics in batch:**

| Stream status | Behaviour | Panics? |
|---|---|---|
| `Active` | Normal accrual + transfer | No |
| `Cancelled` | Accrual frozen at `cancelled_at`; transfers remaining accrued − withdrawn | No |
| `Completed` | Returns `amount = 0`; no transfer, no event | No |
| `Paused` | Returns `ContractError::InvalidState`; entire batch reverts | Yes |
| Wrong recipient | Returns `ContractError::Unauthorized`; entire batch reverts | Yes |

**Atomicity:** the batch is all-or-nothing. Any error (stream not found, wrong
recipient, paused stream) reverts all state changes and token transfers for the
entire call.

**Guardrail (integration tests):** ≤ 10 000 000 CPU instructions, ≤ 4 000 000
memory bytes for a 20-stream batch.

---

### 3. `create_streams` (N streams, single bulk token pull)

**Call pattern:** treasury operator creates multiple streams in one transaction.

**Gas-saving vs N individual `create_stream` calls:**
- Authorization is paid **once**.
- Token transfer is a **single** `transfer(sender → contract, total_deposit)`
  instead of one transfer per stream. This is the primary gas saving: each
  token transfer invokes the SAC contract and incurs its own CPU budget.

**Work done:**
- First pass: validate all entries (pure arithmetic, no storage, no token calls)
- 1× token `transfer` for the sum of all deposits
- Second pass: for each entry — 1× stream ID allocation, 1× persistent write,
  1× recipient-index update, 1× `created` event

**Atomicity:** validation failures, arithmetic overflow in total deposit, or
token transfer failure abort the entire call. No streams are created, no tokens
move, and no events are emitted.

**Guardrail (integration tests):** ≤ 6 000 000 CPU instructions, ≤ 3 000 000
memory bytes for a 10-stream batch.

## Invariants

1. **Accrual is pure.** `calculate_accrued` reads no storage and performs no
   token calls. It is safe to call from any context without budget concern.

2. **CEI ordering.** All three hot paths write state before making external
   token calls. This prevents reentrancy from observing stale state.

3. **Zero-amount paths skip I/O.** When `withdrawable == 0`, no storage write
   and no token transfer occur. Callers may speculatively invoke `withdraw` or
   include already-completed streams in `batch_withdraw` without wasting budget
   on I/O.

4. **Single token pull in `create_streams`.** The total deposit is computed with
   `checked_add` across all entries before any token interaction. Overflow in
   the sum returns `ContractError::InvalidParams` and is atomic.

5. **TTL bumps are bounded.** Every `load_stream` and `save_stream` call bumps
   the persistent entry TTL by at most `PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT` (120 960
   ledgers ≈ 7 days). Instance storage is bumped on every entry-point that
   touches it. These bumps are included in the guardrail measurements above.

## Residual risks and audit notes

- **Recipient-index updates in `create_streams`:** each stream creation calls
  `add_stream_to_recipient_index`, which reads and writes a persistent
  `Vec<u64>` per recipient. For a batch where all streams share the same
  recipient, this is O(N) reads and writes on the same key. The index is
  maintained in sorted order via binary search (O(log N) per insert), but the
  persistent I/O cost is O(N). Operators creating large batches to a single
  recipient should be aware of this.

- **No hard batch size limit.** The contract does not enforce a maximum number
  of entries in `create_streams` or `batch_withdraw`. The Soroban network
  enforces a per-transaction CPU and memory budget; calls that exceed it will
  fail at the network level. The guardrails in the test suite are conservative
  upper bounds, not protocol limits.

- **Token contract trust.** All token transfers use the SAC interface. The
  contract assumes the token contract does not reenter the streaming contract.
  CEI ordering mitigates this risk but does not eliminate it for non-SAC tokens
  if the contract is ever re-initialised with a custom token address.

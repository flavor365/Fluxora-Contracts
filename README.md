# Fluxora Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for the Fluxora treasury streaming protocol on Stellar. Stream USDC from a treasury to recipients over time with configurable rate, duration, and cliff.

## Documentation

- **[Stream contract docs](docs/streaming.md)** — Lifecycle, accrual formula, cliff/end_time, access control, events, and error codes.

<!-- Issue #207 — global resume: scaffold branch. -->
<!-- Admin-only resume clears pause; post-incident checks in docs to follow. -->
<!-- See Fluxora-Org/Fluxora-Contracts#207. -->

## What's in this repo

- **Stream contract** (`contracts/stream`) — Lock USDC, accrue per second, withdraw on demand.
- **Data model** — `Stream` (sender, recipient, deposit_amount, rate_per_second, start/cliff/end time, withdrawn_amount, status).
- **Status** — Active, Paused, Completed, Cancelled.
- **Methods (stubs)** — `init`, `create_stream`, `pause_stream`, `resume_stream`, `cancel_stream`, `withdraw`, `calculate_accrued`, `get_stream_state`.
- **Cancel semantics** — `cancel_stream` is valid only in `Active` or `Paused`; `Completed` and `Cancelled` return `InvalidState`.

Implementation is scaffolded; storage, token transfers, and events are left for you to complete.
- **Methods** — `init`, `create_stream`, `pause_stream`, `resume_stream`, `cancel_stream`, `withdraw`, `calculate_accrued`, `get_stream_state`, `set_admin`.
- **Admin functions** — `pause_stream_as_admin`, `resume_stream_as_admin`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`, `set_admin` for key rotation.

**Documentation:** [Audit preparation](docs/audit.md) (entrypoints and invariants for auditors).

## Tech stack

- Rust (edition 2021)
- [soroban-sdk](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk) (Stellar Soroban)
- Build target: `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for deployment

## Version pinning

This project pins dependencies for **reproducible builds** and **auditor compatibility**:

| Component | Version | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | 1.75 | `rust-toolchain.toml` | Ensures consistent WASM compilation |
| **soroban-sdk** | 21.7.7 | `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml` | Locked to tested Stellar Soroban network version |

When upgrading versions:

1. Update `rust-toolchain.toml` → run `rustup update` → rebuild and test
2. Update `soroban-sdk` version in Cargo.toml → update lock file → run full test suite
3. Verify compatibility with the target Stellar network (testnet, mainnet, etc.)
4. Document the change in the PR or release notes

## Local setup

### Clone and prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fluxora-Org/Fluxora-Contracts.git
cd Fluxora-Contracts
```

- **Rust 1.75+** — Pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (auto-enforced via `rustup`; see [Rust version pinning](#rust-version-pinning))
- **Soroban SDK 21.7.7** — Pinned in `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml` for reproducible builds
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools) (optional, for deploy/test on network)

Install dependencies:

```bash
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then verify:

```bash
rustc --version       # Should show 1.75 or newer
cargo --version
stellar --version     # Only if installing Stellar CLI
```

### Build

From the repo root:

```bash
# Development build (faster compile, for local testing)
cargo build -p fluxora_stream

# Release build (optimized WASM for deployment)
cargo build --release -p fluxora_stream
```

Release WASM output: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fluxora_stream.wasm`.

### Run tests

To run all tests (unit and integration tests), use:

```bash
cargo test -p fluxora_stream
```

This runs **unit tests** and **integration tests** in one go. No environment variables or external services are required. Integration tests use Soroban’s in-process test environment (`soroban_sdk::testutils`): the contract and a mock Stellar asset are built in memory, so no emulator or network is needed.
**Note:** Tests rely on the `testutils` feature of the `soroban-sdk` to simulate the ledger environment and manipulate time (e.g., fast-forwarding to test cliff and end periods). 
This feature is already enabled in `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml` under `[dev-dependencies]`. No extra environment setup is required.

The test files are located at:
- Unit tests: `contracts/stream/src/test.rs`
- Integration tests: `contracts/stream/tests/integration_suite.rs`

- **Unit tests**: `contracts/stream/src/test.rs` (contract logic, accrual, auth, edge cases).
- **Integration tests**: `contracts/stream/tests/integration_suite.rs` — full flows with `init`, `create_stream`, `withdraw`, `get_stream_state`, lifecycle and edge cases (double init, pre-cliff withdraw, unknown stream id, underfunded deposit).

### Deploy to Stellar Testnet

> **📋 See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for a complete step-by-step deployment checklist**, including build, deploy, init, and verification steps.

Quick start:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your STELLAR_SECRET_KEY, STELLAR_TOKEN_ADDRESS, STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS

source .env
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh
```

Then invoke `create_stream`, `withdraw`, etc. as needed. Contract ID is saved to `.contract_id`.

## Documentation

- **[Storage Layout](docs/storage.md)** — Contract storage architecture, key design, and TTL policies

## Accrual formula (reference)

- **Accrued** = `0` when `current_time < cliff_time`
- Otherwise: `min((min(current_time, end_time) - start_time) * rate_per_second, deposit_amount)`
- **Withdrawable** = `Accrued - withdrawn_amount`
- No accrual after `end_time` (elapsed time is capped at `end_time`).

# WASM Build Hash Verification

After each CI build, the pipeline computes a SHA256 hash of the contract WASM artifact(s) and uploads them as CI artifacts. This allows deployers and auditors to verify that the deployed contract matches the tested build.

Artifacts:
- fluxora_stream.wasm.sha256 — Hash of the main WASM build
- fluxora_stream.optimized.wasm.sha256 — Hash of the optimized WASM (if present)

To verify a deployment:
1. Download the hash artifact from the CI run (GitHub Actions > Artifacts > fluxora_stream-wasm-hash).
2. Compute the SHA256 hash of your local WASM file:
   bash
   sha256sum path/to/your/fluxora_stream.wasm
   
3. Compare the output to the CI hash file. If they match, your binary is identical to the tested build.

This improves supply-chain clarity and ensures reproducible deployments.
